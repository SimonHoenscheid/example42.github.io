---

When we joined as individuals the [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) community almost ten years ago, we learned that this community was different. The most important drive here has always been: try to be helpful and inclusive!

Shortly after [example42 GmbH](https://example42.com/) was founded, in October 2015, we were accepted as Puppet Channel Partner.

This partnership allows Puppet Inc and example42 GmbH to work closely together on training, consulting, migrations and any aspect of a [Puppet Enterprise](https://puppet.com/products/puppet-enterprise) installation.

Several of the relevant engagements been conducted by [Alessandro Franceschi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrofranceschi), CTO at example42 GmbH.

We are super excited that Alessandro is rewarded as Channel Partner **Engineer of the Year** for "exemplifying excellence in engineering and solving customer challenges using Puppet products".

Additionally example42 GmbH is rewarded as **Service Delivery Partner of the Year in EMEA** region, "driving additional services, regular availability, and bench growth".
