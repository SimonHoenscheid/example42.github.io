title: Tip of the Week 24 - Puppet 5
---

Puppet 5 was scheduled to be released somehwere near May 2017.
The release was postponed due to some CVE on existing supported Puppet versions.

So we expect Puppet 5 to be available quite soon.
Therefor it is now time to work on Puppet 5 updates.

Most important is to mention that Puppet 5 does not require any Puppet code changes.
It is still recommended to update to latest Puppet 4 version prior upgrading to Puppet 5.

The packages layout and directory structure has not changed. Agent and Master still install into /opt/puppetlabs.
Hardware requirements are also identical to Puppet 4.

The master now requires Java 8 and has the eyaml gem contained inside the package.
PuppetDB now needs PostgreSQL 9.6!!
Puppetserver now has a newer JRuby version. This requires to reinstall all server gems!

At time of this writing the following versions are bundled:
