title: Tip of the Week 58 - News from FOSDEM and Configuration Management Camp
---

Example42 attended [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018/) in Brussels and will be at [Configuration Management Camp](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/) in Ghent.

### FOSDEM

### CfgMgmtCamp

This year, example42 is again sponsoring CfgMgmtCamp. We believe that the Ghent based event - celebrating its 5th year anniversary - is one of the most important ones to attend when being interested in Configuration Management.

It was clear from the beginning that this even will not focus on one technology only, but wants to be a place where all tools covering configuration management will collaboratively work together.

This year, the main stage will start with several, well known people - and we are very happy to see them again:

- [Mark Burgess (CFEngine)](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/main/Mark.html)
- [Luke Kanies (Puppet)](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/main/Luke.html)
- [Adam Jacob (Chef)](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/main/adam-jacob.html)
- [Mike Place (Salt)](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/schedule/main/Even.html)

Besides the founders or creators of configuration management tools, we will also hear from people directly involved with tools in the business.

As usual the agenda is split into general sessions covering DevOps and Configuration Management and tool specifc sessions covering Ansible, Chef, CFEngine, Foreman, Juju, Kubernetes, Mgmt Config, Puppet, Rudder, Salt, Terraform.

On Wendesday fringe events will start, covering

- Foreman Constructoin day
- puppethack day
- Habitat and InSpec Hackday
- Mgmt Hackaton
- Container Trouble Shooting Workshop with SysDig
- CFEngine and IoT hackaton
- Ansible Lightbulb Workshop

These are very tool specifc sessions which operate indipendently. Choose wiseley on where to head to.

Happy System and COnfiguration Automation,

Martin Alfke
