title: example42 is rewarded twice at 2018 Puppet Channel Partner Awards
---

When we joined the [Puppet](https://puppet.com/) community almost ten years ago, we learned that this community was different. The most important topic was: try to be helpful!

Shortly after [example42 GmbH](https://example42.com/) was founded, we were accepted as Puppet Channel Partner. This partnership gives Puppet access to our knowledge and resources and allows us to work on every aspect of a [Puppet Enterprise](https://puppet.com/products/puppet-enterprise) installation.

Several of these engagements have been conducted by [Alessandro Franceschi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrofranceschi), CTO at example42 GmbH. We are super excited that Alessandro is rewarded as Channel Partner Engineer of the Year for "exemplifying excellence in engineering and solving customer challenges using Puppet products".

Additionally example42 GmbH is rewarded as Service Delivery Partner of the Year in EMEA region, "driving additional services, regular availability, and bench growth".
