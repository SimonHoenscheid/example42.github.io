title: Tip of the Week 13 - Environment caches
---

Usually a Puppet Server as a monolithic installation can handle up to 4000 nodes. In larger environments one can easily scale this by adding compile servers placed behind a load balancer.

But prior you throw additional hardware on your load issue, Puppet server allows you for some scaling.
One of the ways to prevent scaling issues is to make use of Puppet environment cache.
