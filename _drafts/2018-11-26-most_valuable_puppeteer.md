title: Tip of the Week 100 - Puppet Community Award
---

Puppet is a product built around a community.
The Puppet community encourages learning new skills, recognizing practical knowledge and honor contributions.

Once in the year Puppet community honors other community members by voting for the MVP (Most Valued Puppeteer) award.

As far as I remeber the first MVP award was given to Eric Dalen at PuppetConf 2014 for his feedback and help on PuppetDB.
In 2015 Mark Sutter was honored for his work on the Windows Powershell DSC module.
At Puppetconf in 2016 the award has been given to Rob Nelson.
I was unable to find information on 2017 award. I ony found a tweet mentioning Roy Sugahara and Tim Meusel as MVP runnersup.

In 2018 Tim was again on the MVP list, but [this time](https://puppet.com/blog/big-thank-you-years-community-award-winners) he was recognized for his phantastic work within voxpupuli - the GitHub Puppet Community.
