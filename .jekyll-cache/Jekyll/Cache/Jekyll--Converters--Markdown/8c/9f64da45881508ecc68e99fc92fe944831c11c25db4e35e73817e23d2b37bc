<h2 id="efficient-consulting">Efficient Consulting</h2>

<p>There is a major difference between effective and efficient consulting. Within effective consulting companies get solutions and support in a fast and reliable matter.</p>

<p>We prefer efficient consulting, where we enable customer teams to understand the solutions and are able to continue maintaining them by themselves.</p>

<p>This allows companies to be less reliant on long term external consulting and results in happier staff.</p>

<h2 id="services">Services</h2>

<p>At example42 we not only deliver consulting, we also support teams by conducting specific trainings on DevOps related tool chains and offer Puppet code maintenance support.</p>

<p>Our maintenance contract takes the burden from teams when it comes to building Puppet code following modern best practice and not being blocked by deprecations when it comes to Puppet upgrades.</p>

<p>Especially in the DevOps world training is one of the essentials tasks which must be done to keep pace with modern best practice.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-sharing">Knowledge sharing</h2>

<p>We have always shared, and will continue to share, our experience on Puppet, operations, automation and DevOps. A list of the material, software and documentation we have shared includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This same <a href="https://www.example42.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>, with our Tips of the Week on Puppet and DevOps</li>

  <li><a href="https://github.com/example42/psick" target="_blank">PSICK</a> a Puppet control-repo and module to easily setup a full featured Puppet infrastructure</li>
</ul>
