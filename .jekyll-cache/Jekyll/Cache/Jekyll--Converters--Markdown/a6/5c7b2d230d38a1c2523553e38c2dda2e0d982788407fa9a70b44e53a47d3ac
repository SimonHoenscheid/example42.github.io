I"o<p>Puppet is a product built around a community.</p>

<p>The Puppet community encourages learning new skills, expanding knowledge and honors contributions.</p>

<p>We want to celebrate the 100th post in our Puppet Tip of the Week celebrating the same Puppet community of which we are proud members and talking about this year edition of Puppet MVP (Most Valued Puppeteer) award.</p>

<p>The MVP award is voted by community and Puppet members and given to people in the community who have distinguished themselves in their Puppet activities.</p>

<p>As far as I remember the first MVP award <a href="https://puppet.com/blog/contributor-summit-puppetconf-2014-edition">was given to Eric Dalen at PuppetConf 2014</a> for his feedback and help on PuppetDB.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/coopjn/status/652543484885270528">2015 Mark Sutter was honored</a> for his work on the Windows Powershell DSC module.</p>

<p>At Puppetconf in <a href="https://puppet.com/blog/puppet-community-mvp-rob-nelson-learning-puppet">2016 the award has been given to Rob Nelson</a> for most fixed tickets at a triage.</p>

<p>I was unable to find information on 2017 award. I only found a <a href="https://twitter.com/puppetize/status/918534243952754690">tweet mentioning Ryo Sugahara and Tim Meusel</a> as MVP runnersup.</p>

<p>This years Community Awards have expanded, with new mentions to <strong>Invaluable Puppeteer</strong> and <strong>Force Multiplier</strong>.</p>

<p>Tim was again on the MVP list, but <a href="https://puppet.com/blog/big-thank-you-years-community-award-winners">this time</a> he was recognised for his fantastic work within voxpupuli - the GitHub Puppet Community.</p>

<p>Nick Maludy won the Force Multiplier award for his contributions to Bolt, and Iâ€™m am proud and happy for being nominated as Invaluable Puppetteer.</p>
