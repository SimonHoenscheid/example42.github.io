<p>Ouch. Exec resource abusing seems to be an often used pattern.</p>

<p>Consider an Exec resource being an emergency exit. It is a powerful resource type that offers you to do almost anything to a system.</p>

<p>But please keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

<p>You (as the author of the Exec resource type declaration) are responsible for idempotency and error handling.</p>

<p>Best practice is to have an Exec resource for one-time commands only. This does not refer to a single puppet run, but throughout the life cycle of the system.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to make use of the exec resource type parameters for idempotency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>onlyif</li>
  <li>unless</li>
  <li>refreshonly</li>
  <li>creates</li>
</ul>

<p>And don’t forget to set the path parameter.</p>
