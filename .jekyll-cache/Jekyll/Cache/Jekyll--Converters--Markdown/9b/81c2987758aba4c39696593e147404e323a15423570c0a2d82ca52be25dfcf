I"<p><a href="http://github.com/example42/puppet-tp">Tiny Puppet</a> is a Puppet module that abstracts application management.</p>

<p>It provides a set of Puppet defined types to manage installation and configuration of potentially any application on any Operating System (<code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::install</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::conf</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::dir</code>… ).</p>

<p>When Tiny Puppet was released Puppet 4 was still not available, so all its code is compatible with Puppet 3 (and actually also with Puppet 4 and Puppet 2). Yet the power of the future parser is undeniable so we started to make some Puppet 4 only versions of the main tp defines, adding a <code class="highlighter-rouge">4</code> suffix to them (<code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::install4</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::conf4</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::dir4</code>… ).</p>

<p>Now we are approaching the release 1.0 of Tiny Puppet and a relevant choice has to be done: should we keep on preserving old parser compatibility or jump hands and feet on the future (parser?)</p>

<p>We decided to jump, so starting from version 1.x the standard tp defines are going to be compatible only with Puppet 4. Puppet 3 compatible defines will have the <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> suffix (<code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::install3</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::conf3</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::dir3</code>… ), and, to ease migration on current codebase, they are already available.</p>

<p>So, summing up, the current version of tp (0.9.x) has this layout for defines:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tp::install  # Works on Puppet 2, 3 and 4
tp::install3 # Works on Puppet 2, 3 and 4, the same of of tp::install
tp::install4 # Optimized for Puppet 4 (doesn't work on earlier versions)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When tp 1.x will be released, in mid November, we want to switch this naming as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tp::install  # Optimized for Puppet 4 (doesn't work on earlier versions)
tp::install3 # Works on Puppet 2, 3 and 4 the same of tp::install from 0.x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The current code and documentation refer to the pre 1.x layout: this will be changed at 1.0.0 release.</p>

<p>If you are using Tiny Puppet 0.x and have Puppet 4 you have probably nothing to do, the new functions work as before, a few, rarely used,  parameters will be removed</p>

<p>If you have a Puppet 3 environment you should start to use defines with the 3 suffix (renaming functions like <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::conf</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::conf3</code>), in order to be able to seamlessly upgrade to tp 1.x when released.</p>

<p>If you are still not using Tiny Puppet, give it a try. It can do a lot of useful things for you, and, we think it will be able to do much more with the powers of Puppet 4.</p>
