I"ÿ<p>New year, new challenges. At example42 we continuously develop Puppet solutions but we seldomly take the occasion to talk about them.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve decided, starting today, to publish every week a blog post with tips and infos about Puppet, DevOps, Automation and what we do with it.</p>

<p>Since the 31st of December 2016 Puppet 3 has reached its End Of Life, so we think itâ€™s a good occasion to begin the new year and our journey with how to install or upgrade Puppet 4.</p>

<p>If you want it on Linux you can follow the <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/install_linux.html">official documentation</a> or you can just run this command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example42/control-repo/production/bin/puppet_install.sh | sudo bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or, if you are lazy:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wget -O - https://bit.ly/installpuppet | sudo bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The script automatically detects the underlying OS, <strong>removes existing Puppet installations and repos</strong>, installs the relevant, official, repositories for Puppet 4 and then installs the puppet-agent package.</p>

<p>It currently supports installation on Linux (RedHat and derivatives, Fedora, Suse, Debian, Ubuntu) and MacOS/Darwin. Check online reference for <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/install_windows.html">installing Puppet on Windows</a>.</p>

<p>It runs totally unattended, so it can be used during automated provisioning of servers on public or private clouds.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t like the idea of running as root scripts from the Internet, even worse via an url shortener, you are right and you already know what do do: download the script, analyze it, place it in a safe location and run it from there.</p>

<p>Or just fire the above one-liner and forget: it will work in the same way ;-)</p>
