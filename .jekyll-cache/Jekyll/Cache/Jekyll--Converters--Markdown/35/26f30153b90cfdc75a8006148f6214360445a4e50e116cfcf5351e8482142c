I"Ñ<p>October 7th, 2015 has been a special day for us: example42 GmhB has been officially registered and can begin its business, based in Berlin.</p>

<p>We were at the PuppetConf in Portland that day and we celebrated there as the youngest company at the event while Martin performed his talk about <a href="http://sched.co/3h0R">Puppet 4</a>.</p>

<p>We are enrolling as Puppet Labs Training and Service Delivery Partners and will provide to our customers a full range of Puppet related services.</p>

<p>Business is business, but ideas donâ€™t change: example42 is still embracing Open Source, all our Puppet modules are and will continue to be free as speech and beer and to stress our commitment we have launched a new, ambitious, project: <strong>The [DevOps] Guide to Puppet Universe and Everything</strong>.</p>

<p>It is an holistic, Open Source, <a href="http://www.example42.com/guide/">documentation project</a> composed of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>book</strong> about Puppet and DevOps practices</li>
  <li>A set of commented <strong>sample code</strong> architectures</li>
  <li>A modular <strong>slides deck</strong></li>
  <li>A practical <strong>Puppet Universal Reference</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We have launched an <a href="http://igg.me/at/guide42">IndieGogo campaign</a> about it, if you want to support this effort, please give it a look.</p>

<p>We plan to release the first works on the guide very soon.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, something awesome is going to happen.</p>
