I"Y<p>Any Puppet infrastructure must be monitored and needs log checking.<br />
For monitoring we can re-use existing solutions like cacti, checkmk, icinga, monit, munin, nagios, sensu, zabbix <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_network_monitoring_systems">see also Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Every puppet agent has locally stored important information for your puppet infrastructure. Most of these informations are stored inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">statedir</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>puppet agent --configprint statedir
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/state

tree /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/state
/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache/state
|- classes.txt
|- graphs
|- last_run_report.yaml
|- last_run_summary.yaml
|- resources.txt
|- state.yaml
\- transactionstore.yaml
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One wants to check not only for running puppet agent, but also for proper catalog retrieval. This can be achieved by analyzing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">last_run_summary.yaml</code> file.</p>

<p>For logchecking it is possible to re-use your exiting log infrastructure like syslog-ng, elasticsearch or splunk. Within a basic puppet installation logfiles are written to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">logdir</code> setting.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>puppet master --configprint logdir
/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver

tree /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver
/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver
|- masterhttp.log
|- puppetserver-access.log
\- puppetserver.log
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most important is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">puppetserver.log</code> files <strong>deprecation messages</strong>. These messages inform you of upcoming incompatibilities with your puppet code.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>grep deprecated /var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/puppetserver.log

<p>Still most of these tools don’t give you an insight on Puppet internal status or provide information about all changes of your infrastructure. This is where the Puppet reporting frontends come into place.</p>

<p>There are several possible solutions available:</p>

<p>As Puppet Enterprise user you will get the Puppet Enterprise Console installed automatically. On Puppet Open Source no webinterface will get installed automatically.</p>

<p>For both platforms it is possible to make use of other open source developments:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard">Puppet Board</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/dalen/puppet-explorer">Puppet Explorer</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both webinterfaces require PuppetDB configured as reporting backend. This is easily possible by setting the reports setting in puppet.conf for the puppet server to ‘puppetdb’</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[server]
reports = puppetdb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is one major difference between PuppetBoard/PuppetExplorer and the Puppet Entrprise Console: PuppetBoard/PuppetExplorer only have read access to PuppetDB. They are not designed to be able to work as External Nodes Classifier.</p>

<p>With Puppet 5 there is another possible source of information where you can receive insights of your Puppet server status: the Puppet server <strong>metrics backend</strong>.</p>

<p>This backend was originally available on Puppet Enterprise only and has been ported to Puppet Open Source.</p>

<p>The following settings must be activated:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/puppetserver.conf
# enable metrics in http-client
http-client: {
  metrics-enabled: true
}

#/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/conf.d/metrics.conf
metrics: {
# a server id that will be used as part of the namespace for metrics produced
# by this server
server-id: localhost
registries: {
    puppetserver: {
        # specify metrics to allow in addition to those in the default list
        #metrics-allowed: ["compiler.compile.production"]

        reporters: {
            # enable or disable JMX metrics reporter
            jmx: {
                enabled: true
            }
            # enable or disable Graphite metrics reporter
            graphite: {
                enabled: true
            }
        }

    }
}
# this section is used to configure settings for reporters that will send
# the metrics to various destinations for external viewing
reporters: {
    graphite: {
        # graphite host
        host: "127.0.0.1"
        # graphite metrics port
        port: 2003
        # how often to send metrics to graphite
        update-interval-seconds: 5
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
