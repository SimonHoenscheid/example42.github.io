I"_<p>Lately I’ve rediscovered an option of Puppet’s <strong>file</strong> resource that can be incredibly useful and, surprisingly, doesn’t seem to be widely used.</p>

<p>Since Puppet 4.6 the file resource type has the <a href="https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/type.html#file-attribute-validate_cmd">validate_cmd</a> attribute, which allows to run a command to check the syntax of a file before actually applying it to the system.</p>

<p>For example we can write:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>file { '/etc/nginx/nginx.conf':
  content      =&gt; 'This can be wrong',
  validate_cmd =&gt; 'nginx -t -c %',
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to make Puppet run the specified <code class="highlighter-rouge">validate_cmd</code> on the file we are trying to provide, which is referenced by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">%</code> sign (can be configured with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">validate_replacement</code> attribute).</p>

<p>Needless to say that this is extremely useful to prevent accidental failures in managed systems due to incorrect syntax (or incomplete values, due to missing variables) in the provided configuration files for the managed applications.</p>

<p>This is what happens in a Puppet run when we try to provide a file with a wrong syntax for which is defined the <code class="highlighter-rouge">validate_cmd</code> attribute:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">Notice: /Stage[main]/Psick::Nginx::Tp/Tp::Conf[nginx]/File[/etc/nginx/nginx.conf]/content:

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Puppet shows the diff of the file but it doesn’t actually change it, as the validate command has returned an error (any exit code different from 0).</p>

<p>Since the file resource has failed, also the dependent resources, as the nginx service, are skipped.</p>

<p>On the system the original file and the relevant service have remained untouched.</p>

<p>We have just added such functionality to <a href="https://github.com/example42/puppet-tp/commit/209e9c811881c4dd8c5443fde2183f3225daded0">Tiny Puppet</a>, now, whenever there’s the relevant Tiny Data for an application, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tp::conf</code> defines runs a validate command for the files it provides.</p>

<p>Configuration on Tiny Data is easy, check <a href="https://github.com/example42/tinydata/commit/2b07697e8d246c6a6583a3f083330eae76209bc8">this commit</a> for an example.</p>

<p>Note that it’s possible, in Tiny Data, either to define a single string containing the validation script, or an hash, where is possible to define what command to run for what configuration file type.</p>

<p>For example, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">httpd -t -f %</code> command can be used only with the main Apache configuration file (base_file = ‘config’), as it would fail with configuration fragments as can be virtual hosts definitions.</p>

<p>Expect more TinyData to appear in the future to add configuration validation to applications managed by Tiny Puppet, and, please, feel free to send Pull Requests to TinyData, similar to the one linked earlier, to add support to new applications.</p>
