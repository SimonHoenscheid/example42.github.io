I"$<p>When we joined as individuals the <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a> community almost ten years ago, we learned that this community was different. The most important drive here has always been: try to be helpful and inclusive!</p>

<p>Shortly after <a href="https://example42.com/">example42 GmbH</a> was founded, in October 2015, we were accepted as Puppet Channel Partner.</p>

<p>This partnership allows Puppet Inc and example42 GmbH to work closely together on training, consulting, migrations and any aspect of a <a href="https://puppet.com/products/puppet-enterprise">Puppet Enterprise</a> installation.</p>

<p>Several of the relevant engagements have been conducted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandrofranceschi">Alessandro Franceschi</a>, CTO at example42 GmbH.</p>

<p>We are super excited that Alessandro is rewarded as Channel Partner <strong>Engineer of the Year</strong> for “exemplifying excellence in engineering and solving customer challenges using Puppet products”.</p>

<p>Additionally example42 GmbH is rewarded as <strong>Service Delivery Partner of the Year in EMEA</strong> region, “driving additional services, regular availability, and bench growth”.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-puppet-channel-partner">What is a Puppet Channel Partner?</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://puppet.com/partners/channel-partner-program">Puppet Channel Partner</a> supports Puppet in being present at market and engages in Puppet community.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-a-service-delivery-partner-adds-value">How does a Service Delivery Partner adds value?</h2>

<p>When using the supported Puppet Enterprise Platform, customers need to ensure that any work inside the platform is done in accordance to Puppet guidelines.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://puppet.com/partners/service-delivery-partner-program">Service Delivery Partner</a> must have at least one Puppet Certified Consultant and support Puppet Enterprise customers in all technical aspects of their Puppet platform.</p>

<h2 id="why-example42-gmbh">Why example42 GmbH?</h2>

<p>At example42 GmbH two long time Puppet experts have combined their Puppet knowledge, each one having more that ten years of hands-on Puppet experience.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we participate in a world-wide network of Puppet experts and contribute to the community with our <a href="https://github.com/example42">Open Source</a> modules and Puppet related projects.</p>

<p>We are happy and proud of being part of this world.</p>
