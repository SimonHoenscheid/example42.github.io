I"<p>Example42 site has been moved.</p>

<p>It was running on Drupal, with a few plugins, an essential theme and a hugely spammed comment system.</p>

<p>I hardly used most of Drupal features and was quite annoyed by the continuous need to update it, even if this can be done quickly with drush.</p>

<p>When I started to look around for alternatives I searched for a lightweight Content Management System that could allow me to write quickly texts and save me from using directly html tags and badly manageable WYSIWYG editors.</p>

<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and its integration with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> seemed the right solution.</p>

<p>Being a design donkey I searched for some good theme, based on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">BootStrap</a> (because eveyrthing nowadays has to be based on Bootstrap, right?).</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://bootflat.github.io/">Bootflat</a>. I like it. Powerful, essential, clean.</p>

<p>I imported my previous blog posts from Drupal using <a href="http://import.jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll Import</a> and copied from <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/">Carl Boettiger site</a> some plugins and design approaches.</p>

<p>The result is here, credits and my personal thanks go to the previous resources. Thanks you!</p>

<p>Only time will tell if this is enough for me to write more stuff here.</p>

<p>For the moment, thank you for being here, links around will point you to the online resources where you can see my Puppet works.</p>
